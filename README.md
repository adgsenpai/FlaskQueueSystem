Of course! I'll provide you with a basic README structure based on the Flask application with RQ integration and progress reporting that we've been discussing. Please adapt and expand it according to your specific project details and requirements.

## Flask + RQ Task Progress Reporter

This project is a Flask application integrated with RQ (Redis Queue) to handle background tasks. It provides real-time progress reporting on a task through a simple web frontend.

### Features:

- **Start Task Button**: Initiates a long-running task.
- **Progress Bar**: Provides a visual and percentage representation of the task's progress.

### Prerequisites:

1. Python 3.x
2. Redis server

### Installation:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adgsenpai/FlaskQueueSystem
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd FlaskQueueSystem
   ```

3. **Install Required Python Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask rq redis
   ```

4. **Start Redis Server**:
   Depending on your environment, you might start Redis with a simple `redis-server` command or using a specific service manager.

### Usage:

1. **Start Flask App**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Start RQ Worker**:
   In another terminal instance:
   ```bash
   rq worker
   ```

3. **Open Browser**:
   Navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/
